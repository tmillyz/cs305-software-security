Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a firm that is creating financial services for customers to choose from that is created per the customers individual needs. Artemis wants to insure that the data it stores and or transmits is secured since it will include sensitive customer information. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? I think that doing the dependency checks was something that I did very well.  Checking for flase positives and suppressing those in the checks was one of the parts I enjoyed doing the most. Software security adds credibility to the company's online presence and softwares and increases trust with its consumers.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? The most challenging of it was 
I continually had trouble with the security certificates that I was creating.  Even though I was able to successfully setup the security key on my computer I could not get it to show the cert where the file itself was secured.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? I tried creating the SSL certificates and applying them to my file to increase security.  Once I successfully apply it to the files, I would use it in the future. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? I would run the project and check to see if tasks where being completed or if I was getting any errors in my code.  If so I would go back and refactor the code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? Resources I used where the textbook as well as docs on OWASP and other security sites.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?  I would present the vulnerability assessment that was completed in project one.
